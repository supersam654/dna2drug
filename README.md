# dna2drug
DNA2Drug is a powerful tool leveraging computational genomics and precision medicine to revolutionize cancer diagnoses and deliver personalized treatment plans to practicing physicians instantly.Our platform is capable of taking a fundamental cDNA sequence, identify specific mutations and what level of risk they put a patient at, AND determine a patient-specific drug treatment plan. We aim to use digital therapeutics and computational genomics to provide oncologists with more comprehensive and accurate cancer diagnoses and personalize care delivered to patients.

Our analysis and predictive algorithms are supported by extensive empirical data regarding genetic mutations strongly correlated to tumor growth.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Input a sequence of human coding DNA (exome) into the text field. Hit 'Submit'. Our algorithms identify the gene of interest and find mutation sites empirically related to incidence of breast cancer. Using this and extensive databases, our servers correlate the mutation with a subset of breast cancer and determine an optimal drug/treatment regimen for the patient.
