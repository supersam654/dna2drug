  "name": "Geftinib",
  "gene": "EGFR",
  "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5687/1163",
  "description": "Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor's (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain. Thus gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor. The target protein (EGFR) is a family of receptors which includes Her1(erb-B1), Her2(erb-B2), and Her 3(erb-B3). EGFR is overexpressed in the cells of certain types of human carcinomas - for example in lung and breast cancers. This leads to inappropriate activation of the anti-apoptotic Ras signalling cascade, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Research on gefitinib-sensitive non-small cell lung cancers has shown that a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is responsible for activating anti-apoptotic pathways. These mutations tend to confer increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Of the types of non-small cell lung cancer histologies, adenocarcinoma is the type that most often harbors these mutations. These mutations are more commonly seen in Asians, women, and non-smokers (who also tend to more often have adenocarcinoma).Â¶ Gefitinib inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. Thus the function of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in activating the anti-apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascade is inhibited, and malignant cells are inhibited."

treatmentList.Cetuximab = {
  "name": "Cetuximab",
  "gene": "EGFR",
  "url": "http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm172905.htm",
  "description": "When growth factors bind to their receptors on the surface of the cell, the receptors give a signal that causes cells to divide. Some cancers are caused by mutated receptors that give a signal to divide even without growth factor. That causes the cells to divide uncontrollably. Cetuximab binds to such receptors and turns off that signal. The EGFR sends a signal down a pathway (see MAPK) that includes another protein, KRAS (also spelled K-ras). In some cancers, the EGFR is mutated, and is present to a larger or smaller degree. In these cancers, the KRAS protein may either be 'wild type' or mutated. If mutated, KRAS sends a signal to divide uncontrollably, even if EGFR has been blocked by cetuximab. Cetuximab binds to EGFR and turns off the uncontrolled growth in cancers with EGFR mutations (although in practice, studies have shown that the effect of cetuximab does not actually depend on the amount of EGFR receptor protein found on the cancer cells). However, if the KRAS protein is mutated, cetuximab has been found not to work, because the mutated KRAS gene downstream is causing the problem by continuously sending a growth signal (the KRAS protein) and this mutated gene now does not respond to the EGFR. Therefore, before cetuximab is used, the standard of care is that the KRAS gene in the cancer cells is tested for mutation. If KRAS is normal (wild type), cetuximab might work. But if KRAS is mutated, indications are that cetuximab (and also panitumumab) will not work, because the mutated KRAS gene continuously sends a KRAS protein signal to divide, even when cetuximab has turned the earlier EGFR signal off."

treatmentList.Lapatinib = {
  "name": "Lapatinib",
  "gene": "ERBB2, ERBB4",
  "url": "http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/18/6652",
  "description": "Lapatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with two oncogenes, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2/neu (Human EGFR type 2). Over expression of HER2/neu can be responsible for certain types of high-risk breast cancers in women. Like sorafenib, lapatinib is a protein kinase inhibitor shown to decrease tumor-causing breast cancer stem cells. Lapatinib inhibits receptor signal processes by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR/HER2 protein kinase domain, preventing self-phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the signal mechanism."

treatmentList.Trastuzumab = {
  "name": "Trastuzumab",
  "gene": "ERBB2",
  "url": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/nature01392.html",
  "description": "Trastuzumab binds to domain IV of the extracellular segment of the HER2/neu receptor. Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle so there is reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab induces some of its effect by downregulation of HER2/neu leading to disruption of receptor dimerization and signaling through the downstream PI3K cascade. In addition, trastuzumab suppresses angiogenesis both by induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. One of the most relevant proteins that trastuzumab activates is the tumor suppressor p27 (kip1), also known as CDKN1B. Trastuzumab activates p27 by simultaneously inhibiting PI3K/Akt, Mirk, hKIS, pathways Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells."

treatmentList.Imatinib = {
  "name": "Imatinib",
  "gene": "KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB",
  "url": "http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management",
  "description": "Imatinib is a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the TK active site, leading to a decrease in activity. There are a large number of TK enzymes in the body, including the insulin receptor. Imatinib is specific for the TK domain in abl (the Abelson proto-oncogene), c-kit and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of abl with bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed bcr-abl. As this is now a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease bcr-abl activity. The active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of bcr-abl, locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation. Imatinib is quite selective for bcr-abl, though it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), but acts on no other known tyrosine kinases. Imatinib also inhibits the abl protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on bcr-abl. Inhibition of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death."

treatmentList.Dasatinib = {
  "name": "Dasatinib",
  "gene": "KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB",
  "url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697539/",
  "description": "Dasatinib binds to the ATP-binding site, but extends in the opposite direction from imatinib. Dasatinib binds the inactive and active conformation of the ABL kinase domain, requires fewer contact points with ABL, and has a greater affinity to the ABL kinase domain compared to imatinib. In vitro, dasatinib has demonstrated greater than 325-fold activity against BCR-ABL wild-type, and the kinase activity of 14 of 15 BCR-ABL imatinib-resistant isoforms has been successfully inhibited at nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib. The activity of dasatinib against several ABL kinase mutations is explained by the fact that it does not require interaction with some of the residues involved in those mutations. Dasatinibâs inhibiting potential against Src family kinase members is greater (IC50 0.5 nmol/L) than its inhibitory activity against ABL (1 nmol/L). At nanomolar concentrations, dasatinib also inhibits c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and EphA2. Potent Src inhibitory activity of dasatinib in CML progenitors involves BCR-ABLâdependent and BCR-ABLâindependent Src activity. Dasatinib also inhibits downstream signaling pathways in CML progenitors, as well as P-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), P-Akt, and P-STAT5 levels in CML progenitors in the absence but not in the presence of growth factors. In addition, dasatinib significantly suppressed CML colony-forming cells and long-term culture-initiating cells."

  "description": "Nilotinib is an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase. Nilotinib binds to and stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain of ABL protein. In vitro, nilotinib inhibited BCR-ABL mediated proliferation of murine leukemic cell lines and human cell lines derived from patients with Ph+ CML. Under the conditions of the assays, nilotinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase mutations, in 32 out of 33 mutations tested. In vivo, nilotinib reduced the tumor size in a murine BCR-ABL xenograft model. Nilotinib inhibited the autophosphorylation of the following kinases at IC50 values as indicated: BCR-ABL (20 to 60 nM), PDGFR (69 nM), c-KIT (210 nM), CSF-1R (125 to 250 nM), and DDR1 (3.7 nM)."

  "description": "It is an inhibitor of the enzyme janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and janus kinase 3 (JAK 3) , which means that it interferes with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which transmits extracellular information into the cell nucleus, influencing DNA transcription. In a mouse model of established arthritis, tofacitinib rapidly improved disease by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and suppressing STAT1-dependent genes in joint tissue. This efficacy in this disease model correlated with the inhibition of both JAK1 and 3 signaling pathways, suggesting that tofacitinib may exert therapeutic benefit via pathways that are not exclusive to inhibition of JAK3."
