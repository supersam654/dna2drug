      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>Input a section of a human DNA genome into the textbox, then hit Submit.
          Our algorithms identify the gene of interest, find mutations in the
          gene, and determine if they are potential risk factors for breast
          cancer. We'll even provide suggested drugs for treatment, specifically
          for the sarcomas typical of the malformed genes.</p>
      <p>Our science is based on published material by some of the world's
          leading researchers. To learn more, look into "Somatic Mutations
          and Breast Cancer"
